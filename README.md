# Hello World!

## Hello and welcome to a collection of my uni courses and assignments :mortar_board:

Most of my coursework to date has been in Python and R and you'll find various tests (programming) and assignments (programming + data analysis + reporting) here.
Thanks for coming, I appreciate you taking the time to look at my work.

### Definitely  check out :thumbsup:
Probably the best place to start would be my 'Job Market' exam. This was a comprehensive project in R which involved data scraping from seek.com.au, data analysis, report writing (analysis/visualisations) and dashboard creation.

### Also worth a look :eyes:
My Yelp assignment was also in R and involved data analysis on a large data set from Yelp.com and a written report with analysis and visualisations

My Covid assignment was in Python using Jupyter Notebook. It involved a lot of data cleaning then a written analysis and visualisations of Covid data across different Australian states
