# Hello World!
Hello and welcome to my 'website' :)

I use the term loosely because I haven't learned how to make them yet.

Hopefully you're here because you clicked on the link in my CV (thanks for that) and you're looking for some of my work.

You'll find it here: https://sigint-141-12.github.io/
