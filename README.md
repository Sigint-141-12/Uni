# Hello World!
Hello and welcome to my 'website' :)

I use the term loosely because I haven't learned how to make them yet.

Hopefully you're here because you clicked on the link in my CV (thanks for that) and you're looking for some of my work.

You'll find it here: [https://sigint-141-12.github.io/](https://github.com/Sigint-141-12)

My hope is that I improve enough to look back on this code and feel a bit embarassed. But for now, I'm pretty happy with it
