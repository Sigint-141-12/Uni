This project involved the utilisation of the programming language R to develop a simulation of a Covid-19 infection within a society. 

The objective was to create a code that could adjust various variables, such as population size, average number of daily close contacts, and virus infection rate, in order to model the number of healthy, sick, and deceased individuals. Additionally, the simulation incorporated additional parameters like immunity effectiveness and duration of immunity.

The primary goal of this exercise was to gain insight into how different viral characteristics impact the spread of a pandemic. For instance, the simulation aimed to determine whether highly transmissible but low mortality viruses are more lethal than others. Furthermore, it sought to ascertain the effectiveness of various human responses, such as implementing lockdowns to reduce the number of daily close contacts versus relying on vaccination.
